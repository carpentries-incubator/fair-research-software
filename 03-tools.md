:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What tools are available to help us develop research software in a FAIR way?
- How do the tools fit together to enable FAIR research?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
After completing this episode, participants should be able to:

- Identify some key tools for FAIR research software
- Explain how can these tools help us work in a FAIR way
- Install and run these key tools on learner's machines

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this course we will introduce you to a group of tools and practices that are commonly used in research to help you 
develop software in a FAIR way. 
You should already have these tools installed on your machine following the setup instructions. 
Here we will give an overview of the tools, how they help you achieve the aims of FAIR research software and how 
they work together. 
In later episodes we will describe some of these tools in more detail.

The table below summarises some tools and practices that can help with each of the FAIR software principles.

## Writing your code

### Development environment

One of the first choices we make when writing code is what tool to use to do the writing.
You can use a simple text editor such as Notepad, a terminal based editor with syntax highlighting such as Vim or Emacs, 
or one of many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) which give you the tools to write, run and debug your code 
and inspect the output all in one place. 
Note that you should not use word processing software such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to write code - 
these tools are designed to create nicely formatted text for humans to read, so they may add or change formatting, 
or insert invisible characters that the programming language cannot interpret. 
Try opening a Word document in Notepad to see an example.

This is mostly a personal choice as an experienced user of any of these tools can write good, FAIR software efficiently, 
but IDEs are popular because they are designed specifically for writing and running code.
There are some language specific IDEs such as PyCharm, and some that can work with many languages like 
VS Code (Visual Studio Code). 
IDEs also have add-ons that provide extra functionality, such as checking your code as you type 
(similar to a spell-checker in Word), highlighting when you are not following best practice, or even automatically 
generating bits of code for you.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
At this point you could open the Python file or another file in VS Code to show all the squiggly lines suggesting 
improvements.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this course we will use VS Code IDE, as it is free, available on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, 
and can be used with many programming languages. 
It is a single tool in which we can:

- view our file system
- open many kinds of files
- edit, compile, run and debug code
- open a terminal to run command line tools (including version control tool Git) or view code outputs

Use VS Code to open the Python script and the data file from our project.

### Command line tool/shell

In VS Code and similar IDEs you can often run the code by clicking a button or pressing some keyboard shortcut.
If you gave your code to a colleague or collaborator they might use the same IDE or something different, 
so you cannot guarantee that they will have the same buttons and shortcuts as you.

In the previous episode we mentioned that interoperable software should use standard protocols so that it can 
integrate with other tools.
One of these standard protocols/tools is using the inputs and outputs via the command line terminal or shell.
Command line terminal provides one of the oldest ways of interacting with operating system so many programs will 
have command line interfaces.
Command line terminals, such as Bash and Zsh, have their own language syntax that allow you to write scripts and/or 
group and chain commands together to build up complex workflows using several programs in different steps. 
They also use less resources than a graphical user interface tool like an IDE, so are commonly used on 
high-performance computers and other shared systems where time, memory and processing power are expensive or in 
high demand.

In this course we will use the Bash shell, which is one of the most common and comes already installed on Mac and 
Linux operating systems.
You can create a command line interface to your program which will allow it to be run on any system that has a Bash 
shell, and allow users to change things like input and output files or choose different settings or parameters 
without editing your code.
With a command line interface, your code can be built into automated workflows so that the whole process from data 
gathering to analysis to saving publication-quality results can be written in one Bash script and saved and reused.

### Version control

Version control means knowing what changes were made to your code and when. Many people who have worked on large 
documents such as essays start doing this by saving files called `essay_draft`, `essay_version1.doc`, 
`essay_version2.doc`, and so on. 
This can work on a small scale but most people find it quickly gets confusing which version a certain change was made, 
or which version is the one that you got feedback from a supervisor on. Using a version control system helps you 
keep track of changes, including when you might be working on shared code being edited by more than one person at a time.

It also lets you assign version numbers or tags to particular versions so you can then use those to refer back to 
them later. 
For example, you can run your code and output some results and add a comment to your output that those results were 
produced by version 2.4 of your code, so if you try to run the same thing later and find it is different, you can 
check if it is a change in the code due to using a newer version, or a change in the data, or something else.

We will be using the Git version control system, which can be used through the command line terminal, 
in a browser or in a desktop application.

### Testing

Testing ensures that your code is correct and does what it is set out to do. When you write code you often feel very 
confident that it is perfect, but when writing bigger codes or code that is meant to do complex operations it is 
very hard to consider all possible edge cases or notice every single typing mistake. 
Testing also gives other people confidence in your code as they can see an example of how it is meant to run and 
be assured that it does work correctly on their machine.

We will show different ways to test your code for different purposes. You need to think about what it is that is 
important to you and any future users or collaborators to decide what kind of testing is most useful for you.

### Documentation

Documentation comes in many forms - from the names of variables and functions in your code, additional comments 
that explain some lines, up to a whole website full of documentation with function definitions, usage examples, 
tutorials and guides. 
You many not need as much documentation as a large commercial software product, but making your code Reusable relies 
on other people being able to understand what your code does and how to use it.

### Licences and citation

A licence states what people can legally do with your code, and what restrictions you have placed on it. 
Whenever you want to use someone else's code you should check what license they have and make sure your use is legal. 
You may be restricted by your institution, your grant funding, or by other tools you use that require certain licenses 
for you to be compatible with them.

Having a citation instructions is not a legal requirement but if you want to get academic credit for your work, 
you can make other people's life much easier by telling them how you would like to be credited. 
Similarly, follow citation instructions ensures that when you use others' code in your research they will be 
credited accordingly.

Both licensing law and citation procedures can vary depending on your country and institution, 
so remember to check with a local team where you are. 
Your local research IT support or library teams would be a good place to start.

### Code repositories and registries

Having somewhere to share your code is fundamental to making it Findable. 
Your institution might have a code repository, your research field may have a practice of sharing code via a specific 
website or journal, or your version control system might include an online component that makes sharing different 
versions of your code easy. 
Again, remember to check the rules of your institution and grant on publishing code, and any licenses for code you 
depend on or reuse.

We will discuss later how to share your code on GitHub and make it easy for others to find and use.

## Summary

- Communication protocols - CLI/API

### Reusable

- Document functionality/installation/running
- Follow best practices where appropriate
- License
- Citation

## Checking your setup

::::::  challenge

Open a command line terminal and look at the prompt. 
Compare what you see in the terminal with your neighbour, does it look the same or different?
What information is it telling you and why might this be useful? 
What other information might you want?

Run the following commands in a terminal to check you have installed the tools listed in the Setup page. 
Compare the output with your neighbour and see if you can see any differences.

Checking the command line terminal:

1. `date`
2. `echo $SHELL`
3. `pwd`
4. `whoami`

Checking Python:

5. `python --version`
6. `python3 --version`
7. `which python`
8. `which python3`

Checking Git and GitHub:

9. `git --help`
10. `git config --list`
11. `ssh -T git@github.com`

Checking VS Code:

12. `code`
13. `code --list-extensions`

::: hint

The prompt is the `$` character and any text that comes before it, that is shown on every new line before you type in 
commands.
Type each of the commands one at a time and press enter. 
They should give you a result by printing some text in the terminal.

:::

::: solution

The expected out put of each command is:

1. Today's date
2. `bash` or `zsh` - this tells you what shell language you are using. In this course we show examples in Bash.
3. Your "present working directory" or the folder where your shell is running
4. Your username
5. In this course we are using Python 3. If `python --version` gives you Python 2.x you may have two versions of Python installed on your computer and need to be careful which one you are using.
6. Use this command to be certain you are using Python version 3, not 2, if you have both installed.
7. The file path to where the Python version you are calling is installed.
8. If you have more than one version these should be different paths, if both 5. and 6. gave the same result then 7. and 8. should match as well.
9. The help message explaining how to use the `git` command.
10. You should have `user.name`, `user.email` and `core.editor` set in your Git configuration. Check that the editor listed is one you know how to use.
11. This checks if you have set up your connection to GitHub correctly. If is says `permission denied` you may need to look at the instructions for setting up SSH keys again on the Setup page.
12. This should open VSCode in your current working directory. macOS users may need to first open VS Code and [add it to the PATH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
13. You should have the extensions GitLens, Git Graph, Python, JSON and Excel Viewer installed to use in this course.

You may have noticed that our researcher has received the software project they are meant to be working as 
a `.zip` archive via email. 
In the next episode, we will learn a better practice for sharing and tracking changes to a software project using 
version control software Git and project sharing and collaboration platform GitHub.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Automating your analysis with shell scripts allows you to save and reproduce your methods.
- Version control helps you back up your work, see how data and code change over time and identify which analysis used which data and code.
- Programming languages each have advantages and disadvantages in different situations. Use the correct tools for your own work.
- Integrated development environments (IDEs) automate many coding tasks, provide easy access to documentation, and can identify common errors.
- Testing helps you check that your code is behaving as expected and will continue to do so in the future or when used by someone else.
