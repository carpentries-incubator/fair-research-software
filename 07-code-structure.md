:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can we best structure code?
- What is a common code structure (pattern) for creating software that can read input from command line?
- What are conventional places to store data, code, results, tests, auxiliary information and metadata 
within our software or research project? 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
After completing this episode, participants should be able to:

- Structure code into smaller, reusable components with a single responsibility/functionality.
- Use the common code pattern for creating software that can read input from command line
- Follow best practices for organising software/research project directories for improved 
readability, accessibility and reproducibility.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the previous episode we have seen some tools and practices that can help up improve readability of our code - 
including breaking our code into small, reusable functions that perform one specific task.
We are going to explore a bit more how using common code structures can improve readability, accessibility and 
reusability of our code, and will expand these practices on our (research or code) projects as a whole.

### Activate your virtual environment
If it is not already active, make sure to activate your virtual environment from the root of
the software project directory:

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/bin/activate # Mac or Linux
$ source venv_spacewalks/Scripts/activate # Windows
(venv_spacewalks) $
```

## Functions for modular and reusable code 

As we have already seen in the previous episode - functions play a key role in creating modular and reusable code.
We are going to carry on improving our code following these principles:

- Each function should have a single, clear responsibility. This makes functions easier to understand, test, and reuse.
- Write functions that can be easily combined or reused with other functions to build more complex functionality.
- Functions should accept parameters to allow flexibility and reusability in different contexts; avoid hard-coding 
values inside functions/code (e.g. data files to read from/write to) and pass them as arguments instead.

Bearing in mind the above principles, we can further simplify the main part of our code by extracting the code to 
process, analyse our data and plot a graph into a separate function `plot_cumulative_time_in_space`.

We can further extract the code to convert the spacewalk duration text into a number to allow for arithmetic 
calculations (into a separate function `text_to_duration`) and 
the code to add this numerical data as a new column in our dataset (into a separate function 
`add_duration_hours_variable`).

The main part of our code then becomes much simpler and more readable, only 
containing the invocation of the following three functions:

```python
...
eva_data = read_json_to_dataframe(input_file)
write_dataframe_to_csv(eva_data, output_file)
plot_cumulative_time_in_space(eva_data, graph_file)
...

```
Remember to add docstrings and comments to the new functions to explain their functionalities. 

Our new code (with the three new functions `plot_cumulative_time_in_space`, `text_to_duration` and 
`add_duration_hours_variable`) may look like the following.

```python


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd


def read_json_to_dataframe(input_file):
    """

    print(f'Reading JSON file {input_file}')
    eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
    eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
    eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
    eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)
    return eva_df

    df_copy = df.copy()

        text_to_duration
    )
    return df_copy


def plot_cumulative_time_in_space(df, graph_file):

    Returns:

    """
    print(f'Plotting cumulative spacewalk duration and saving to {graph_file}')
    df = add_duration_hours_variable(df)
    df['cumulative_time'] = df['duration_hours'].cumsum()
    plt.plot(df.date, df.cumulative_time, 'ko-')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(graph_file)
    plt.show()


# Main code

print("--START--")

input_file = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
output_file = open('./eva-data.csv', 'w')
graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'

eva_data = read_json_to_dataframe(input_file)

write_dataframe_to_csv(eva_data, output_file)

plot_cumulative_time_in_space(eva_data, graph_file)

print("--END--")


```

As you may notice, the main part of our code has now been majorly simplified and is much easier to follow.

## Command-line interface to code

A common way to structure code is to have a command-line interface to allow the passing of various parameters. 
For example, we can pass the input data file to be read and the output file 
to be written to as parameters to our script and avoid hard-coding them.
This improves interoperability and reusability of our code as it can now be run over any data file of the same structure, 
invoked from the command line terminal and integrated into other scripts or workflows/pipelines. 
For example, another script can produce our input data and can be "chained" with our code in a more complex data 
analysis pipeline.
Another use case would be invoking our script in a loop to automatically analyse a number of input data files (compare
that to running the script manually over hundreds or thousands of files - which is slow, error-prone and requires manual
intervention).

There is a common code structure (pattern) for writing code with a command-line interface in Python:

```python
# import modules

def main(args):
    # perform some actions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # perform some actions before main()
    main(args)
```

In this pattern the main actions performed by the script are contained within the `main` function
(which does not need to be called `main`, but using this convention helps others in understanding your code).
The `main` function is then called within the `if` statement `__name__ == "__main__"`,
after some other actions have been performed (usually the parsing of command-line arguments, 
which will be explained below).
`__name__` is a special variable which is set by the Python interpreter before the execution of any code in the 
source file.
What value is given by the interpreter to `__name__` is determined by the manner in which the script is invoked.

If we run the source file directly using the Python interpreter, e.g.:

```bash
$ python3 eva_data_analysis.py
```

then the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string `"__main__"` to the `__name__` variable:

```python
__name__ = "__main__"
...
# rest of your code
```

However, if your script is imported by another Python script, e.g. in order to reuse its functions, with:

```python
import eva_data_analysis
```

then the Python interpreter will assign the name "eva_data_analysis" from the import statement to the 
`__name__` variable (note that import statement matches our script's name):

```python
__name__ = "eva_data_analysis"
...
# rest of your code
```

Because of this behaviour of the Python interpreter, we can put any code that should only be executed when running 
the script directly within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` structure,
allowing the rest of the code within the script to be safely imported by another script if we so wish.

While it may not seem very useful to have your script importable by another script,
there are a number of situations in which you would want to do this:

- for testing of your code, you can have your testing framework import your script,
  and run special test functions which then call the `main` function directly;
- where you want to not only be able to run your script from the command-line,
  but also provide a programmer-friendly application programming interface (API) for advanced users.

We will use the `sys` library to read the command line arguments passed to our script and make them available in our
code as a list - remember to import this library first.

Our modified code will now look as follows.

```python
import json
import csv
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import sys

def main(input_file, output_file, graph_file):
    print("--START--")

    eva_data = read_json_to_dataframe(input_file)

    write_dataframe_to_csv(eva_data, output_file)

    plot_cumulative_time_in_space(eva_data, graph_file)

    print("--END--")

def read_json_to_dataframe(input_file):
    """
    Read the data from a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe.
    Clean the data by removing any incomplete rows and sort by date

    Args:
        input_file_ (str): The path to the JSON file.

    Returns:
         eva_df (pd.DataFrame): The cleaned and sorted data as a dataframe structure
    """
    print(f'Reading JSON file {input_file}')
    eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
    eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
    eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
    eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)
    return eva_df


def write_dataframe_to_csv(df, output_file):
    """

    Args:

def add_duration_hours_variable(df):

    print(f'Plotting cumulative spacewalk duration and saving to {graph_file}')
    df = add_duration_hours_variable(df)
    df['cumulative_time'] = df['duration_hours'].cumsum()
    plt.plot(df.date, df.cumulative_time, 'ko-')
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(graph_file)
    plt.show()


if __name__ == "__main__":

    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        input_file = './eva-data.json'
        output_file = './eva-data.csv'
        print(f'Using default input and output filenames')
    else:

        print('Using custom input and output filenames')

    graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'
    main(input_file, output_file, graph_file)

```

We can now run our script from the command line passing the JSON input data file and CSV output data file as:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python eva_data_analysis.py eva-data.json eva-data.csv
```

Remember to commit our changes.

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ git status
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add eva_data_analysis.py
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Add command line functionality to script"

## Directory structure for software projects

Expanding on the code structure theme, following conventions on consistent and informative directory structure 
for your projects will ensure people will immediately know where to find things within your project, especially helpful 
for long-term research projects or when working in teams.
The directory structure for organising your research software project 
(or research projects in general) involves creating a clear and logical layout for files and data, 
ensuring easy navigation, collaboration and reproducibility. 

Below are some good practices for setting up and maintaining a research project directory structure.

1. Top-level directory
    - Put all files related to a project into a single directory
    - Choose a meaningful name that reflects the project’s purpose or topic.
2. Subdirectories - organise the project into clear, well-labeled sub-directories based on the type of content. 
Common categories include:
    - Data - store raw, intermediate, and processed data in separate sub-directories to maintain clarity and avoid overwriting and losing your raw data
    - Code/scripts/src - for storing your source code
    - Results - for storing analysis outputs, summary statistics, or any data generated after processing.
    - Documentation - include a detailed project description and documentation on how the project is organised, methodologies, and file dependencies.
    - Figures/Plots - store all visualisations like charts, graphs, and figures generated from the analysis (these can also go in the results directory).
    - References - a folder for research papers, articles, or any other literature cited or referenced in the project.
3. Naming conventions
    - Avoid special characters or spaces (they can cause errors when read by computers); use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead 
    - Name files to reflect their contents, version, or date (or use version control to track different versions).
4. Use version control
   - Code and data should be version controlled; you can also version control manuscripts, results, etc. 
   - If data files are too large (or contain sensitive information) to track by version control, untrack them using `.gitignore` 
   - Use tags/releases to mark specific versions of results (a version submitted to a journal, dissertation version, poster version, etc.)
   so as to avoid using version numbers in file names and proliferation of different files.
