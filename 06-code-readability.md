::: questions

-   Why does code readability matter?
-   How can I organise my code to be more readable?
-   What types of documentation can I include to improve the readability of my code?

:::

::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to:

-   Organise code into reusable functions that achieve a singular purpose
-   Choose function and variable names that help explain the purpose of the function or variable
-   Write informative comments and docstrings to provide more detail about what the code is doing

:::

In this episode, we will introduce the concept of readable code and consider how it can help create reusable 
scientific software and empower collaboration between researchers.

When someone writes code, they do so based on requirements that are likely to change in the future.
Requirements change because software interacts with the real world, which is dynamic.
When these requirements change, the developer (who is not necessarily the same person who wrote the original code) 
must implement the new requirements.
They do this by reading the original code to understand the different abstractions, and identify what needs to change.
Readable code facilitates the reading and understanding of the abstraction phases and, as a result, facilitates the 
evolution of the codebase.
Readable code saves future developers' time and effort.

In order to develop readable code, we should ask ourselves: "If I re-read this piece of code in fifteen days or one 
year, will I be able to understand what I have done and why?" 
Or even better: "If a new person who just joined the project reads my software, will they be able to understand 
what I have written here?"

We will now learn about a few software best practices we can follow to help create more readable code.

### Activate your virtual environment
If it is not already active, make sure to activate your virtual environment from the root of
the software project directory:

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/bin/activate # Mac or Linux
$ source venv_spacewalks/Scripts/activate # Windows
(venv_spacewalks) $
```
:::

::: instructor

At this point, the code in your local software project's directory should be as in:
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronaut-data-analysis-not-so-fair/tree/06-code-readability.

:::

## Place `import` statements at the top

Let's have a look our code again - the first thing we may notice is that our script currently places import statements 
throughout the code.
Conventionally, all import statements are placed at the top of the script so that dependent libraries
are clearly visible and not buried inside the code (even though there are standard ways of describing dependencies -
e.g. using `requirements.txt` file).
This will help readability (accessibility) and reusability of our code.

Our code after the modification should look like the following.

```python
import json
import csv
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# https://data.nasa.gov/resource/eva.json (with modifications)
data_f = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
data_t = open('./eva-data.csv','w')
g_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png' 


fieldnames = ("EVA #", "Country", "Crew    ", "Vehicle", "Date", "Duration", "Purpose")

data=[]

for i in range(374):
    line=data_f.readline()
    print(line)
    data.append(json.loads(line[1:-1]))
#data.pop(0)
## Comment out this bit if you don't want the spreadsheet

w=csv.writer(data_t)

time = []
date =[]

j=0
for i in data:
    print(data[j])
    # and this bit
    w.writerow(data[j].values())
    if 'duration' in data[j].keys():
        tt=data[j]['duration']
        if tt == '':
            pass
        else:
            t=dt.datetime.strptime(tt,'%H:%M')
            ttt = dt.timedelta(hours=t.hour, minutes=t.minute, seconds=t.second).total_seconds()/(60*60)
            print(t,ttt)
            time.append(ttt)
            if 'date' in data[j].keys():
                date.append(dt.datetime.strptime(data[j]['date'][0:10], '%Y-%m-%d'))
                #date.append(data[j]['date'][0:10])

            else:
                time.pop(0)
    j+=1

t=[0]
for i in time:
    t.append(t[-1]+i)

date,time = zip(*sorted(zip(date, time)))

plt.plot(date,t[1:], 'ko-')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(g_file)
plt.show()
```

Let's make sure we commit our changes.

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add eva_data_analysis.py
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Move import statements to the top of the script"
```

## Use meaningful variable names

Variables are the most common thing you will assign when coding, and it's really important that it is clear what each variable means in order to understand what the code is doing.
If you return to your code after a long time doing something else, or share your code with a colleague, it should be easy enough to understand what variables are involved in your code from their names.
Therefore we need to give them clear names, but we also want to keep them concise so the code stays readable.
There are no "hard and fast rules" here, and it's often a case of using your best judgment.

Some useful tips for naming variables are:

- Short words are better than single character names. For example, if we were creating a variable to store the speed 
to read a file, `s` (for 'speed') is not descriptive enough but `MBReadPerSecondAverageAfterLastFlushToLog` is too long 
to read and prone to misspellings. `ReadSpeed` (or `read_speed`) would suffice.
- If you are finding it difficult to come up with a variable name that is both short and descriptive, 
go with the short version and use an inline comment to describe it further (more on those in the next section). 
This guidance does not necessarily apply if your variable is a well-known constant in your domain - 
for example, *c* represents the speed of light in physics.
- Try to be descriptive where possible and avoid meaningless or funny names like `foo`, `bar`, `var`, `thing`, etc.

There are also some restrictions to consider when naming variables in Python:

- Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are permitted in variable names.
- You cannot begin your variable names with a numerical character as this will raise a syntax error.
Numerical characters can be included in a variable name, just not as the first character. For example, `read_speed1` is a valid variable name, but `1read_speed` isn't. (This behaviour may be different for other programming languages.)
- Variable names are case sensitive. So `speed_of_light` and `Speed_Of_Light` are not the same.
- Programming languages often have global pre-built functions, such as `input`, which you may accidentally overwrite 
if you assign a variable with the same name and no longer be able to access the original `input` function. In this case, 
opting for something like `input_data` would be preferable. Note that this behaviour may be explicitly disallowed in other 
programming languages but is not in Python.

### Give a descriptive name to a variable

Below we have a variable called `var` being set the value of 9.81.
`var` is not a very descriptive name here as it doesn't tell us what 9.81 means, yet it is a very common constant in physics!
Go online and find out which constant 9.81 relates to and suggest a new name for this variable.

Hint: the units are *metres per second squared*!

``` python
var = 9.81
```

::: solution
### Solution

$$ 9.81 m/s^2 $$ is the [gravitational force exerted by the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth).
It is often referred to as "little g" to distinguish it from "big G" which is the [Gravitational Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant).
A more descriptive name for this variable therefore might be:

``` python
g_earth = 9.81
```

### Rename our variables to be more descriptive

Let's apply this to `eva_data_analysis.py`.

a. Edit the code as follows to use descriptive variable names:

    - Change data_f to input_file
    - Change data_t to output_file
    - Change g_file to graph_file
    
b. What other variable names in our code would benefit from renaming? 
c. Commit your changes to your repository. Remember to use an informative commit message.


::: solution

Updated code:
```python
import json
import csv
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# https://data.nasa.gov/resource/eva.json (with modifications)
input_file = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
output_file = open('./eva-data.csv', 'w')
graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'


fieldnames = ("EVA #", "Country", "Crew    ", "Vehicle", "Date", "Duration", "Purpose")

data=[]

for i in range(374):
    line=input_file.readline()
    print(line)
    data.append(json.loads(line[1:-1]))
#data.pop(0)
## Comment out this bit if you don't want the spreadsheet

w=csv.writer(output_file)

time = []
date =[]

j=0
for i in data:
    print(data[j])
    # and this bit
    w.writerow(data[j].values())
    if 'duration' in data[j].keys():
        tt=data[j]['duration']
        if tt == '':
            pass
        else:
            t=dt.datetime.strptime(tt,'%H:%M')
            ttt = dt.timedelta(hours=t.hour, minutes=t.minute, seconds=t.second).total_seconds()/(60*60)
            print(t,ttt)
            time.append(ttt)
            if 'date' in data[j].keys():
                date.append(dt.datetime.strptime(data[j]['date'][0:10], '%Y-%m-%d'))
                #date.append(data[j]['date'][0:10])

            else:
                time.pop(0)
    j+=1

t=[0]
for i in time:
    t.append(t[-1]+i)

date,time = zip(*sorted(zip(date, time)))

plt.plot(date,t[1:], 'ko-')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(graph_file)
plt.show()
```
We should also rename variables `w`, `t`, `ttt` to be more descriptive.

Commit changes:
```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add eva_data_analysis.py
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Use descriptive variable names"
```

::::::

## Use standard libraries

Our script currently reads the data line-by-line from the JSON data file and uses custom code to manipulate
the data.
Variables of interest are stored in lists but there are more suitable data structures (e.g. data frames)
to store data in our case.
By choosing custom code over standard and well-tested libraries, we are making our code less readable and understandable
and more error-prone.

The main functionality of our code can be rewritten as follows using the `Pandas` library to load and manipulate the 
data in data frames.

First, we need to install this dependency into our virtual environment (which should be active at this point).

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python -m pip install pandas
```
The code should now look like:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Data source: https://data.nasa.gov/resource/eva.json (with modifications)
input_file = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
output_file = open('./eva-data.csv', 'w')
graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'

eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)

eva_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

eva_df['duration_hours'] = eva_df['duration'].str.split(":").apply(lambda x: int(x[0]) + int(x[1])/60)
eva_df['cumulative_time'] = eva_df['duration_hours'].cumsum()
plt.plot(eva_df['date'], eva_df['cumulative_time'], 'ko-')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(graph_file)
plt.show()

```

We should replace the existing code in our Python script `eva_data_analysis.py` with the above code and commit the
changes. Remember to use an informative commit message.

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add eva_data_analysis.py
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Refactor code to use standard libraries"
```

Make sure to capture the changes to your virtual development environment too.

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add requirements.txt
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Added Pandas library."
(venv_spacewalks) $ git push origin main
```

## Use comments to explain functionality

Commenting is a very useful practice to help convey the context of the code.
It can be helpful as a reminder for your future self or your collaborators as to why code is written in a certain way, 
how it is achieving a specific task, or the real-world implications of your code.

There are several ways to add comments to code: 

- An **inline comment** is a comment on the same line as a code statement. 
Typically, it comes after the code statement and finishes when the line ends and 
is useful when you want to explain the code line in short. 
Inline comments in Python should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement; they start with a # followed
by a single space, and have no end delimiter.
- A **multi-line** or **block comment** can span multiple lines and has a start and end sequence.
To comment out a block of code in Python, you can either add a # at the beginning of each line of the block or 
surround the entire block with three single (`'''`) or double quotes (`"""`).

``` python
x = 5  # In Python, inline comments begin with the `#` symbol and a single space.

'''
This is a multiline
comment
in Python.
'''
```

Here are a few things to keep in mind when commenting your code:

- Focus on the **why** and the **how** of your code - avoid using comments to explain **what** your code does. 
If your code is too complex for other programmers to understand, consider rewriting it for clarity rather than adding 
comments to explain it.
- Make sure you are not reiterating something that your code already conveys on its own. Comments should not echo your 
code.
- Keep comments short and concise. Large blocks of text quickly become unreadable and difficult to maintain.
- Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping comments up-to-date 
when code changes.

### Examples of unhelpful comments

``` python
statetax = 1.0625  # Assigns the float 1.0625 to the variable 'statetax'
citytax = 1.01  # Assigns the float 1.01 to the variable 'citytax'
specialtax = 1.01  # Assigns the float 1.01 to the variable 'specialtax'
```

The comments in this code simply tell us what the code does, which is easy enough to figure out without the inline comments.

### Examples of helpful comments

``` python
statetax = 1.0625  # State sales tax rate is 6.25% through Jan. 1
citytax = 1.01  # City sales tax rate is 1% through Jan. 1
specialtax = 1.01  # Special sales tax rate is 1% through Jan. 1
```

In this case, it might not be immediately obvious what each variable represents, so the comments offer helpful, 
real-world context.
The date in the comment also indicates when the code might need to be updated.

### Add comments to our code

a. Examine `eva_data_analysis.py`.
Add as many comments as you think is required to help yourself and others understand what that code is doing.
b. Commit your changes to your repository. Remember to use an informative commit message.

### Solution

Some good comments may look like the example below.

``` python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("--START--")
print(f'Reading JSON file {input_file}')
# Read the data from a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe
eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
# Clean the data by removing any incomplete rows and sort by date
eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)

print(f'Saving to CSV file {output_file}')
# Save dataframe to CSV file for later analysis
eva_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

print(f'Plotting cumulative spacewalk duration and saving to {graph_file}')
# Plot cumulative time spent in space over years
eva_df['duration_hours'] = eva_df['duration'].str.split(":").apply(lambda x: int(x[0]) + int(x[1])/60)
eva_df['cumulative_time'] = eva_df['duration_hours'].cumsum()
plt.plot(eva_df['date'], eva_df['cumulative_time'], 'ko-')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(graph_file)
plt.show()
print("--END--")

## Separate units of functionality

Functions are a fundamental concept in writing software and are one of the core ways you can organise your code to 
improve its readability.
A function is an isolated section of code that performs a single, *specific* task that can be simple or complex.
It can then be called multiple times with different inputs throughout a codebase, but its definition only needs to 
appear once.

Breaking up code into functions in this manner benefits readability since the smaller sections are easier to read 
and understand.
Since functions can be reused, codebases naturally begin to follow the [Don't Repeat Yourself principle][dry-principle] 
which prevents software from becoming overly long and confusing.
The software also becomes easier to maintain because, if the code encapsulated in a function needs to change, 
it only needs updating in one place instead of many.
As we will learn in a future episode, testing code also becomes simpler when code is written in functions.
Each function can be individually checked to ensure it is doing what is intended, which improves confidence in 
the software as a whole.

::: callout
Decomposing code into functions helps with reusability of blocks of code and eliminating repetition, 
but, equally importantly, it helps with code readability and testing.
:::

Looking at our code, you may notice it contains different pieces of functionality:

1. reading the data from a JSON file
2. converting and saving the data in the CSV format
3. processing/cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis 
4. data analysis and visualising the results

Let's refactor our code so that reading the data in JSON format into a dataframe (step 1.) and converting it and saving 
to the CSV format (step 2.) are extracted into separate functions.
Let's name those functions `read_json_to_dataframe` and `write_dataframe_to_csv` respectively. 
The main part of the script should then be simplified to invoke these new functions, while the functions themselves 
contain the complexity of each of these two steps. We will continue to work on steps 3. and 4. above later on.

After the initial refactoring, our code may look something like the following.

``` python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

def read_json_to_dataframe(input_file):
    print(f'Reading JSON file {input_file}')
    # Read the data from a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe
    eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
    eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
    # Clean the data by removing any incomplete rows and sort by date
    eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
    eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)
    return eva_df


def write_dataframe_to_csv(df, output_file):
    print(f'Saving to CSV file {output_file}')
    # Save dataframe to CSV file for later analysis
    df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)


# Main code

print("--START--")

input_file = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
output_file = open('./eva-data.csv', 'w')
graph_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'

# Read the data from JSON file
eva_data = read_json_to_dataframe(input_file)

# Convert and export data to CSV file
write_dataframe_to_csv(eva_data, output_file)

print(f'Plotting cumulative spacewalk duration and saving to {graph_file}')
# Plot cumulative time spent in space over years
eva_data['duration_hours'] = eva_data['duration'].str.split(":").apply(lambda x: int(x[0]) + int(x[1])/60)
eva_data['cumulative_time'] = eva_data['duration_hours'].cumsum()
plt.plot(eva_data['date'], eva_data['cumulative_time'], 'ko-')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Total time spent in space to date (hours)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(graph_file)
plt.show()

print("--END--")

```

We have chosen to create functions for reading in and writing out data files since this is a very common task within 
research software.
While these functions do not contain that many lines of code due to using the `pandas` in-built methods that do all the 
complex data reading, converting and writing operations, 
it can be useful to package these steps together into reusable functions if you need to read in or write out a lot of 
similarly structured files and process them in the same way.

## Use docstrings to document functions

Now that we have written some functions, it is time to document them so that we can quickly recall 
(and others looking at our code in the future can understand) what the functions doe without having to read
the code.

*Docstrings* are a specific type of documentation that are provided within functions and [Python classes][python-classes].
A function docstring should explain what that particular code is doing, what parameters the function needs (inputs)
and what form they should take, what the function outputs (you may see words like 'returns' or 'yields' here), 
and errors (if any) that might be raised.

Providing these docstrings helps improve code readability since it makes the function code more transparent and aids 
understanding.
Particularly, docstrings that provide information on the input and output of functions makes it easier to reuse them 
in other parts of the code, without having to read the full function to understand what needs to be provided and 
what will be returned.

Python docstrings are defined by enclosing the text with 3 double quotes (`"""`).
This text is also indented to the same level as the code defined beneath it, which is 4 whitespaces by convention.

### Example of a single-line docstring

``` python
def add(x, y):
    """Add two numbers together"""
    return x + y
```

### Example of a multi-line docstring

``` python
def divide(x, y):
    """
    Divide number x by number y.

    Args:
        x: A number to be divided.
        y: A number to divide by.

    Returns:
        float: The division of x by y.
        
    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: Cannot divide by zero.
    """
    return x / y
```

Some projects may have their own guidelines on how to write docstrings, such as [numpy][numpy-docstring].
If you are contributing code to a wider project or community, try to follow the guidelines and standards they provide 
for code style.

As your code grows and becomes more complex, the docstrings can form the content of a reference guide allowing 
developers to quickly look up how to use the APIs, functions, and classes defined in your codebase.
Hence, it is common to find tools that will automatically extract docstrings from your code and generate a 
website where people can learn about your code without downloading/installing and reading the code files - 
such as [MkDocs][mkdocs-org].

Let's write a docstring for the function `read_json_to_dataframe` we introduced in the previous exercise using the 
[Google Style Python Docstrings Convention][google-doc-string]. 
Remember, questions we want to answer when writing the docstring include:

- What the function does?
- What kind of inputs does the function take? Are they required or optional? Do they have default values?
- What output will the function produce?
- What exceptions/errors, if any, it can produce?

Our `read_json_to_dataframe` function fully described by a docstring may look like: 

```python
def read_json_to_dataframe(input_file):
    """
    Read the data from a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe.
    Clean the data by removing any incomplete rows and sort by date

    Args:
        input_file_ (str): The path to the JSON file.

    Returns:
         eva_df (pd.DataFrame): The cleaned and sorted data as a dataframe structure
    """
    print(f'Reading JSON file {input_file}')
    # Read the data from a JSON file into a Pandas dataframe
    eva_df = pd.read_json(input_file, convert_dates=['date'])
    eva_df['eva'] = eva_df['eva'].astype(float)
    # Clean the data by removing any incomplete rows and sort by date
    eva_df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
    eva_df.sort_values('date', inplace=True)
    return eva_df
```

:::::: challenge

### Writing docstrings

Write a docstring for the function `write_dataframe_to_csv` we introduced earlier.

### Solution 

Our `write_dataframe_to_csv` function fully described by a docstring may look like:

        df (pd.DataFrame): The input dataframe.

::: keypoints
- Readable code is easier to understand, maintain, debug and extend (reuse) - saving time and effort.
- Choosing descriptive variable and function names will communicate their purpose more effectively.
- Using comments and docstrings to describe parts of the code will help transmit understanding and context.
- Use libraries or packages for common functionality to avoid duplication.
- Creating functions from the smallest, reusable units of code will make the code more readable and help. 
compartmentalise which parts of the code are doing what actions and isolate specific code sections for reuse.
