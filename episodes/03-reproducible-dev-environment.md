At this point, the code in your local software project's directory should be as in:
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronaut-data-analysis-not-so-fair/tree/05-reproducible-environment.

:::

So far we have created a local Git repository to track changes in our software project and pushed it to GitHub
to enable others to see and contribute to it. We now want to start developing the code further.

## Software dependencies 

If we have a look at our script, we may notice a few `import` lines such as: `import json`, `import csv`, 
`import datetime as dt` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` throughout the code.
This means that our code depends on or requires several **external libraries**
(also called third-party packages or **dependencies**) to function - namely `json`, `csv`, `datetime` and `matplotlib`.

Python applications often use external libraries that do not come as part of the standard Python distribution.
This means that you will have to use a **package manager** tool to install them on your system.
Applications will also sometimes need a
specific version of an external library
(e.g. because they were written to work with feature, class,
or function that may have been updated in more recent versions),
or a specific version of Python interpreter.
This means that each Python application you work with may require a different setup
and a set of dependencies so it is useful to be able to keep these configurations
separate to avoid confusion between projects.
The solution for this problem is to create a self-contained
**virtual environment** per project,
which contains a particular version of Python installation
plus a number of additional external libraries.

## What are virtual software environments?

So what exactly are virtual software environments, and why use them?

A Python virtual environment helps us create an **isolated working copy** of a software project
that uses a specific version of Python interpreter
together with specific versions of a number of external libraries
installed into that virtual environment.
Python virtual environments are implemented as
directories with a particular structure within software projects,
containing links to specified dependencies
allowing isolation from other software projects on your machine that may require
different versions of Python or external libraries.

It is recommended to create a separate virtual environment for each project.
Then you do not have to worry about changes to the environment of the current project you are working on
affecting other projects - you can use different Python versions and different versions of the same third party
dependency by different projects on your machine independently from one another.

We can visualise the use of virtual environments for different Python projects on the same machine as follows:
![Diagram to depict different Python environments containing different packages on the same machine](episodes/fig/ep05_virtual-env.png){alt='Diagram to depict different Python environments containing different packages on the same machine'}

Another big motivator for using virtual environments is that they make sharing your code with others much easier -
as we will see shortly you can record your virtual environment in a special file and share it with your collaborators
who can then recreate the same development environment on their machines.

You do not have to worry too much about specific versions of external libraries
that your project depends on most of the time.
Virtual environments also enable you to always use
the latest available version without specifying it explicitly.
They also enable you to use a specific older version of a package for your project, should you need to.

## Truly reproducible environments are difficult to attain

Creating and managing isolated environments for each of your software projects and sharing descriptions of those environments alongside the relevant code is a great way to make your software and analyses much more reproducible.
However, "true" computational reproducibility is very difficult to achieve.
For example, the tools we will use in this lesson only track the dependencies of our software, remaining unanware of other aspects of the software's environment such as the operating system and hardware of the system it is running on.
These properties of the environment can influence the running of the software and the results it produces and should be accounted for if a workflow is to be truly reproducible.

Although there is more that we can do to maximise the reproducibility of our software/workflows, the steps described in this episode are an excellent place to start.
We should not let the difficulty of attaining "perfect" reproducibility prevent us from implementing "good enough" practices that make our lives easier and are _much_ better than doing nothing.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Managing virtual environments

There are several command line tools used for managing Python virtual environments - we will use `venv`,
available by default from the standard `Python` distribution since `Python 3.3`.

Part of managing your (virtual) working environment involves
installing, updating and removing external packages on your system.
The Python package manager tool `pip` is most commonly used for this -
it interacts and obtains the packages from the central repository called
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

So, we will use `venv` and `pip` in combination to help us create and share our virtual development environments.

### Creating virtual environments

Creating a virtual environment with `venv` is done by executing the following command:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

where `/path/to/new/virtual/environment` is a path to a directory where you want to place it -
conventionally within your software project so they are co-located.
This will create the target directory for the virtual environment.

For our project let's create a virtual environment called "venv_spacewalks" from our project's root directory.

Firstly, ensure you are located within the project's root directory:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/spacewalks
```

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv_spacewalks
```

If you list the contents of the newly created directory "venv_spacewalks", on a Mac or Linux system
(slightly different on Windows as explained below) you should see something like:

```bash
$ ls -l venv_spacewalks
```

```output
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  12 alex  staff  384  5 Oct 11:47 bin
drwxr-xr-x   2 alex  staff   64  5 Oct 11:47 include
drwxr-xr-x   3 alex  staff   96  5 Oct 11:47 lib
-rw-r--r--   1 alex  staff   90  5 Oct 11:47 pyvenv.cfg
```
So, running the `python3 -m venv venv_spacewalks` command created the target directory called "venv_spacewalks"
containing:

- `pyvenv.cfg` configuration file
  with a home key pointing to the Python installation from which the command was run,
- `bin` subdirectory (called `Scripts` on Windows)
  containing a symlink of the Python interpreter binary used to create the environment
  and the standard Python library,
- `lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` subdirectory (called `Lib\site-packages` on Windows)
  to contain its own independent set of installed Python packages isolated from other projects, and
- various other configuration and supporting files and subdirectories.

Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you will need to activate it.

On Mac or Linux, it is done as:

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/bin/activate
(venv_spacewalks) $
```

On Windows, recall that we have `Scripts` directory instead of `bin`
and activating a virtual environment is done as:

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/Scripts/activate
(venv_spacewalks) $
```

Activating the virtual environment will change your command line’s prompt
to show what virtual environment you are currently using
(indicated by its name in round brackets at the start of the prompt),
and modify the environment so that running Python will get you
the particular version of Python configured in your virtual environment.

You can verify you are using your virtual environment's version of Python
by checking the path using the command `which`:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ which python3
```

When you’re done working on your project, you can exit the environment with:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ deactivate
```

If you've just done the `deactivate`,
ensure you reactivate the environment ready for the next part:

```bash
$ source venv_spacewalks/bin/activate
(venv_spacewalks) $
```

Note that, since our software project is being tracked by Git,
the newly created virtual environment will show up in version control -
we will see how to handle it using Git in one of the subsequent episodes.

### Installing external packages

We noticed earlier that our code depends on four **external packages/libraries** -
`json`, `csv`, `datetime` and `matplotlib`.
As of Python 3.5, Python comes with in-built JSON and CSV libraries - this means there is no need to install these
additional packages (if you are using a fairly recent version of Python), but you still need to import them in any
script that uses them.
However, we still need to install packages `datetime` and `matplotlib` as they do not come as standard with
Python distribution.

To install the latest version of packages `datetime` and `matplotlib` with `pip`
you use pip's `install` command and specify the package’s name, e.g.:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip install datetime
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```

or like this to install multiple packages at once for short:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip install datetime matplotlib
```

The above commands have installed packages `datetime` and `matplotlib` in our currently active `venv_spacewalks`
environment and will not affect any other Python projects we may have on our machines.

If you run the `python3 -m pip install` command on a package that is already installed,
`pip` will notice this and do nothing.

To install a specific version of a Python package
give the package name followed by `==` and the version number,
e.g. `python3 -m pip install matplotlib==3.5.3`.

To specify a minimum version of a Python package,
you can do `python3 -m pip install matplotlib>=3.5.1`.

To upgrade a package to the latest version, e.g. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade matplotlib`.

To display information about a particular installed package do:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip show matplotlib
```
```output

To list all packages installed with `pip` (in your current virtual environment):

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip list
```
```output

zope.interface  7.0.1
```

To uninstall a package installed in the virtual environment do: `python3 -m pip uninstall <package-name>`.
You can also supply a list of packages to uninstall at the same time.

### Sharing virtual environments

You are collaborating on a project with a team so, naturally,
you will want to share your environment with your collaborators
so they can easily 'clone' your software project with all of its dependencies
and everyone can replicate equivalent virtual environments on their machines.
`pip` has a handy way of exporting, saving and sharing virtual environments.

To export your active environment -
use `python3 -m pip freeze` command to produce a list of packages installed in the virtual environment.
A common convention is to put this list in a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
(venv_spacewalks) $ cat requirements.txt
```
```output
contourpy==1.2.1
cycler==0.12.1
DateTime==5.5
fonttools==4.53.1
kiwisolver==1.4.5
matplotlib==3.9.2
numpy==2.0.1
packaging==24.1
pillow==10.4.0
pyparsing==3.1.2
python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
pytz==2024.1
six==1.16.0
zope.interface==7.0.1
```

The first of the above commands will create a `requirements.txt` file in your current directory.
Yours may look a little different,
depending on the version of the packages you have installed,
as well as any differences in the packages that they themselves use.

The `requirements.txt` file can then be committed to a version control system
(we will see how to do this using Git in a moment)
and get shipped as part of your software and shared with collaborators and/or users.

Note that you only need to share the small `requirements.txt` file with your collaborators - and not the entire
`venv_spacewalks` directory with packages contained in your virtual environment.
We need to tell Git to ignore that directory, so it is not tracked and shared - we do this by creating a file
`.gitignore` in the root directory of our project and adding a line `venv_spacewalks` to it.

Let's now put `requirements.txt` under version control and share it along with our code.

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ git add requirements.txt
(venv_spacewalks) $ git commit -m "Initial commit of requirements.txt."
(venv_spacewalks) $ git push origin main
```

Your collaborators or users of your software can now download your software's source code and replicate the same
virtual software environment for running your code on their machines using `requirements.txt` to install all
the necessary depending packages.

To recreate a virtual environment from `requirements.txt`, from the project root one can do the following:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Another challenge in (long-term) reproducibility

For people (including your future self) to be able to reproduce software environments described in this way, the listed dependencies need to remain available to download and possible to install on the user's system.
These are reasonably safe assumptions for widely-used, actively maintained tools on commonly-used operating systems in the short- to medium-term.
However, it becomes less likely that we will be able to recreate such environments as system architectures evolve over time and maintainers stop supporting older versions of software.
To achieve this kind of long-term reproducibility, you will need to explore options to provide the actual environment -- with dependencies already included -- alongside your software e.g. via a [containerised environment](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As your project grows - you may need to update your environment for a variety of reasons, e.g.:

- one of your project's dependencies has just released a new version (dependency version number update),
- you need an additional package for data analysis (adding a new dependency), or
- you have found a better package and no longer need the older package
(adding a new and removing an old dependency).

What you need to do in this case (apart from installing the new and removing the packages that are no longer needed
from your virtual environment) is update the contents of the `requirements.txt` file accordingly
by re-issuing `pip freeze` command and propagate the updated `requirements.txt` file to your collaborators
via your code sharing platform.

### Environment management can be troublesome

Software environment management is a difficult thing to get right, which is one reason why [the Python community has come up with so many different ways of doing it over the years](https://xkcd.com/1987). 
(That webcomic is several years old at the time of writing and the Python environment management ecosystem has only become _more_ complicated since.)
Unfortunately, even if you try to follow good practices and keep your environments isolated it is possible -- perhaps even likely -- that you will face difficulties with installing and updating dependencies on your projects in the coming years.
Such issues are particularly likely to appear when you upgrade your computer hardware, operating system, and/or interpreter/compiler.
As before, this is not a reason to avoid managing your software environments altogether -- or to avoid upgrading your hardware, operating system, etc! 
If you have descriptions of your environments it will always be easier to reproduce them and keep working with your software than if you need to start from scratch.
Furthermore, your expertise will develop as you get more practice with managing your software environments, which will equip you well to troubleshoot problems if and when they arise.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Running the code and reproducing results

We are now setup to run our code from the newly created virtual environment:

```bash
(venv_spacewalks) $ python3 eva_data_analysis.py
```

You should get a pop up window with a graph.
However, some (but not all) Windows users will not.
You might instead see an error like:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Toaster\Desktop\spacewalks\eva_data_analysis.py", line 30, in <module>
    w.writerow(data[j].values())
  File "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_3.12.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\Lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 19, in encode
    return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_table)[0]
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\x92' in position 101: character maps to <undefined>
(spacewalks) (spacewalks)
```

This is not what we were expecting!
The problem is *character encoding*.
'Standard' Latin characters are encoded using ASCII,
but the expanded Unicode character set covers many more.
In this case, the data contains Unicode characters that are represented in the ASCII input file with shortcuts (`Â` as `\u00c2` and `’` as `\u0092`).

When we read the file, Python converts those into the Unicode characters.
Then by default Windows tries to write out `eva-data.csv` using UTF-7.
This saves space compared to the standard UTF-8,
but it doesn't include all of the characters.
It automatically converts `\u0092` into the shorter `\x92`,
then discovers that doesn't exist in UTF-7.

The fact that different systems have different defaults,
which can change or even break your code's behaviour,
shows why it is so important to make our code's requirements explicit!

We can easily fix this by explicitly telling Python what encoding to use when reading and writing our files:

```
data_f = open('./eva-data.json', 'r', encoding='ascii')
data_t = open('./eva-data.csv','w', encoding='utf-8')
```

Now we have the code running in a virtual environment,
in the next episode we will inspect it in more detail,
to see if we can understand and improve it.

## Further reading

We recommend the following resources for some additional reading on the topic of this episode:

Also check the [full reference set](learners/reference.md#litref) for the course.


:::::: keypoints
- Virtual environments keep Python versions and dependencies required by different projects separate.
- A Python virtual environment is itself a directory structure.
- You can use `venv` to create and manage Python virtual environments, and `pip` to install and manage external dependencies your code relies on.
- By convention, you can save and export your Python virtual environment in `requirements.txt` file in your project's root
directory, which can then be shared with collaborators/users and used to replicate your virtual environment elsewhere.
